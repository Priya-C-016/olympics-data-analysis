## Olympic Data Analysis App

### 📌 Overview

The Olympic Data Analysis App is a data-driven project that explores 120 years of Olympic history using data visualization techniques. The app cleans, processes, and analyzes historical Olympic data to extract meaningful insights about athletes, countries, sports, and trends in the Olympics over time.

### 🔍 Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Derived key insights from 120 years of Olympic data.

Data Visualization: Used graphs, charts, and heatmaps to analyze trends and distributions.

Country & Sport Analysis: Studied performance trends of different countries and sports over time.

Athlete Performance Insights: Identified the most successful athletes and their contributions.

Gender Participation Trends: Explored the evolution of gender participation in the Olympics.

Medal Distribution: Analyzed medal-winning patterns across various Olympic events.

### 📊 Technologies Used

Python (for data analysis and processing)

Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (for interactive and static visualizations)

Jupyter Notebook / Streamlit (for interactive data exploration and visualization)

Power BI / Tableau (optional for dashboarding)

### 📂 Dataset
